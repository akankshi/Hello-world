<p>In 1998, before the company was even incorporated, the concept of the doodle was born when 
Google founders Larry and Sergey played with the corporate logo to indicate their 
attendance at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. They placed a stick figure 
drawing behind the 2nd "o" in the word, Google, and the revised logo was intended as a
 comical message to Google users that the founders were "out of office.". While the first doodle 
 was relatively simple, the idea of decorating the company logo to celebrate notable events was 
 born.</p>
